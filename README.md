Learning Basic CPP Especially For The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

1. Encapsulation 
- bundling or tying the data and the methods which operate on the data, so that the data is grouped together within the class
- data hiding, the data is not accessible outside the class, prevent anything outside the class from directly accessing/modifying the data
- the data is only accessible through the methods of the class, which are called "getters and setters"
